                    The MERN stack is a popular JavaScript-based technology stack used for building full-stack web applications. It consists of MongoDB (a NoSQL database), Express.js (a backend web framework), React.js (a frontend library), and Node.js (a runtime for executing JavaScript on the server). MERN allows developers to use JavaScript for both frontend and backend development, making the development process more seamless.
